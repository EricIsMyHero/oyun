# Clash-A-Mana Arena

The standalone game lives at **`arena/index.html`**. Serve the repository over
HTTP and open `/arena/`; it also works beneath a project subdirectory, such as
`/oyun/arena/`. It has no build step, backend, account requirement or multiplayer
service. The opponent is a local tactical bot.

The original Codex, turn-based Battle Arena and Survival entry points remain
separate. Arena loads the same card and spell JSON files without changing them.
New controls and labels are English. Authored ability descriptions retain their
original language; they are not translated at runtime.

## Match rules

| Rule | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Unit deck | Eight different root cards |
| Hand | Four cards; a successful deployment moves its card to the back of the queue |
| Spell deck | Combined Charge must be at most five |
| Active spell | One at a time; a successful cast advances to the next equipped spell |
| Starting mana | 12 |
| Maximum mana | 20 |
| Mana recovery | One mana every 1.3 seconds |
| Starting spell energy | Zero |
| Spell energy limit | No separate cap |
| Paid deployment reward | `Math.round((manaSpent / 18) * 20) / 20` energy |
| Castle | 1,000 health, 25 damage every second, 7.5-tile range, ground and air targets |
| Regulation | Five minutes |
| Overtime | Two minutes if both castles survive regulation; mana recovery doubles |
| Victory | Destroy the opposing castle, or retain more castle health at the end of overtime |
| Draw | Equal castle health after overtime, or both castles destroyed in the same simulation step |

For example, spending 18 mana on a deployment earns one energy; spending 17
earns 0.95. Rounding happens for each successful deployment. Summons and free
transformations do not produce energy. Failed placement, cancellation and an
unaffordable action do not spend resources or advance either queue.

Energy pays the active spell's **Energy** price. **Charge** is deck capacity,
not mana, a casting delay, a cooldown, or a limited number of casts. Two spells
with Charge two fit together; a Charge-five spell fills the complete capacity.
Spells can be used again when their turn returns and sufficient energy exists.

## Three-route battlefield

The original illustrated map places the Azure Core castle at the southwest and
the Crimson Crown castle at the northeast. The central road and two outer roads
connect them through a forest island with rivers, cliffs and three crystal wells.
Each route is **35 tiles** long, with its well **17.5 walking tiles from either
castle**. The central road winds so all three travel distances agree; distance
is measured along road segments, not as a straight line through the terrain.
The map uses world coordinates independently of its isometric screen projection.

Deploy units and spell buildings only on roads or your castle courtyard **within
7.5 tiles of the castle centre**. The courtyard has **one tile of clear space
behind the castle body and 2.5 tiles ahead**, facing the opposing castle, plus a
one-tile side margin. Rear and front clearances are walkable and deployable;
the castle body and occupied building footprints remain blocked. The deployment
radius does not make surrounding forest walkable. Capturing a well does not
unlock an extra deployment zone; normal spells retain their usual target areas.

The castle acquires targets whose body intersects its 7.5-tile firing range;
projectiles travel at most 7.5 tiles. The same geometry and deployment rules
apply to both teams, including the bot.

Each well takes **five uncontested seconds** to capture within its 1.25-tile
radius. Living units, including flying units and summons, can capture; buildings
cannot. Contested progress pauses. If the attacker leaves, its progress resets.
Ownership remains until an opponent finishes a capture. Each owned well adds
**2% mana recovery speed**, up to 6%; overtime doubles the resulting recovery.

Ground units follow the roads. Hovering units also follow the ground routes but
ignore ground-only effects. Flying units travel over terrain. Target layers and
ground immunity remain independent: a hovering unit still belongs to the ground
target layer.

## Codex fidelity and locked cards

All 138 root cards appear in the library, including unavailable cards. A card is
playable only when the source data and its native behavior are sufficiently
defined for this simulator. Locked entries explain the missing fact rather than
substituting invented combat values. Required child forms must also be complete.

Authored `combatStats` fields take priority over class labels and artwork.
Existing single-target projectile width fallback is 500 points. Missing essential
travel distance, unresolved attack variants, absent health, or an unspecified
ability magnitude/trigger can prevent deployment. A dash for a stat that does
not apply is not, by itself, grounds for locking a card. The library and inspector
are the current readiness report; source data is never rewritten to mark cards.

The engine keeps these quantities separate:

- **1,000 points = one tile.** Spatial source values retain their original units
  in data; movement and collision use tiles.
- **Range** acquires a target. **Attack Distance** determines whether the attack
  can reach it. A unit approaches an acquired target until its strike can connect.
- **Projectile Width** describes one strike or projectile. Arc and impact area
  are independent dimensions. Numeric spell Range is a radius; rectangular
  dimensions are full width and height, and Global covers the arena.
- **A × B** means A successive hits for B damage each, including Soldier's
  `15x3`. It does not mean A units or A different enemies. A burst keeps its target.
- **Attack Speed** is the interval between successive hits, in seconds. After
  the final hit, the normal interval plus **Delay** elapses before a new burst.
  A complete repeating burst therefore takes `hitCount × AttackSpeed + Delay`,
  matching the Codex's damage calculation rather than Survival's separate
  weapon timings.
- **Count** is the number of deployed units. Summoning and transformations follow
  the particular card's native rules.
- **DPS** is source reference data. Actual damage per second follows damage,
  intervals, burst timing and effects; the displayed DPS is not multiplied into
  damage a second time. Stat comparison scales are not normalization formulas.

All 24 numeric stats remain available to the simulator and inspector. Shields
share incoming damage with health: at Shield Depletion 70%, 70% goes to shield
and 30% to health. Unabsorbed shield overflow goes to health. Critical resistance
reduces the extra critical portion; Flexibility shortens finite negative-effect
duration. A missing Life limit does not force a unit to expire.

Status definitions follow the Codex: Slow affects movement and attack speed;
Bleeding deals 1% maximum health per second and blocks healing; Poison also
slows movement by 10%; Burn reduces healing by 20%; Invisibility breaks on incoming
damage; Silence disables abilities, rather than ordinary movement or attacks.
The partially outdated generic `effects` arrays are not automatically executed
on top of native card handlers.

Card-only execution, possession and copying do not target castles or crystal
wells. Deaths and secondary effects resolve through the simulation event order,
avoiding repeated kill credit or reflection loops. The bot uses the same selected
deck, costs, mana, energy, capture and placement rules as the player.

## Running and checking

From the repository root, run a static server, for example:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080/arena/`. Card artwork uses the Codex's existing
Cloudflare R2 URLs; unavailable artwork has a local visual fallback.

```sh
node --test tests/*.test.cjs
node tests/arena.browser.cjs
```

The browser check uses Playwright and Chromium (`/usr/bin/chromium`, or set
`CHROMIUM_PATH`). It serves the real application under a project prefix, stubs
external artwork, and exercises deck building, locked-card explanations, resource
accounting, deployment, spell targeting, pause, restart and small-screen layouts.
The test writes preview screenshots under `/tmp` for visual review.
